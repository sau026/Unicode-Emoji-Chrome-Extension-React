Hi, At the time of writing something on social media, I faced a problem that I needed some emojis while writing a post. But as emojis were not available on many platforms, I would have to pick them up from the other Website, So I made this extension so that you can do use it directly using the feature click to copy. 

ðŸ”¹ Press "Alt+Shift+1" to open the extension using the shortcut.

ðŸ”— LinkedIn post link:-

I have to add some more features to it in the coming days. 
Please let me know if you face any issue, I will take that as feedback and try to improve that. ðŸ˜Š
